EXAMINATION REQUIREMENTS 
In addition to passing the required courses listed, New York State has established examination 
requirements.   
1. For the Regents Diploma, student must achieve a score of 65 on the Comprehensive
English CCSS examination, Integrated Algebra CCSS examination, the Global History and
Geography Regents examination, the U.S. History and Government Regents examination,
and one Science Regents examination.
*2. For the Advanced Regents Diploma, in addition to the above, student must achieve a
minimum score of 65 on the Geometry CCSS and Algebra II CCSS examinations, an
additional Science Regents examination, (Physical Setting, one Life Science), and two
additional World Languages units and achieve a score of 65 on a World Languages
Checkpoint B examination.
In addition, students completing a five-unit sequence in career and technical education or the arts 
(visual arts, communication arts, music, or theater) are not required to complete the additional two 
units of World Languages but must still meet the requirements for the total number of units of 
credit.  
3. Local Diploma – Additional graduation pathways and options are available for students with
disabilities.  Students and parents should contact their guidance counselor and/or teacher of
record for more information.
The multiple pathways to graduation are available on the NYS website: 
http://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/multiple-pathways 
[9] 
4. Credential Options
a. Career Development and Occupational Studies Commencement Credential (CDOS).
This credential is available to all students other than those who are NYS Alternately Assessed 
(NYSAA). 
b. Skills and Achievement Commencement Credential.  This credential is available to
students with severe disabilities and are assessed using the NYS Alternate Assessment 
(NYSAA). 
All students must participate in physical education each semester and earn the equivalent 
of two (2) credits by graduation. 
C. CURRICULUM
1. Electives
All students are expected to exceed the minimum graduation requirements.  The
extensive elective choices are available for students to explore their potential future
paths and to be prepared for an ever changing world.  Students should look to
these programs for enrichment and expansion of their knowledge base.  Students
should discuss these options with their Guidance Counselor.
2. Academic Load Requirements
Seniors - five (5) periods of subjects plus physical education
Juniors - six (6) periods of subjects plus physical education
Sophomores and freshmen - eight (8) periods of subjects including physical
education
Exceptions include the work experience program, occupational education, and the
internship program in independent studies. Students who are in their fifth year must
take only the courses they need to graduate.  For juniors and seniors, Resource
Room/Instructional Support are in addition to their minimum academic load.
3. Class Standing - Class of 2019-2022
The number of credits required to maintain class standing is as follows:
Grade 10 -   6.0 Credits 
Grade 11 - 11.0 Credits 
Grade 12 - 16.0 Credits 
4. Valedictorian and Salutatorian
The principal and his committee will determine the valedictorian and salutatorian by
reviewing the academic records at the conclusion of the fall semester of the twelfth
grade.  If, however, there is no clear distinction, the determination will not be made
until the third marking period.  In order to be considered for the distinction of
valedictorian or salutatorian, a student must have been in attendance in Syosset
High School for four semesters of the seven used in this process.
5. Tracking and Acceleration
Based on a student's achievement record and academic ability, the school will
place him/her in a program in English, social studies, and world languages most
suited to his/her immediate needs.  Similarly, in science and mathematics, students
who qualify may take certain courses a year earlier than usual.
[10] 
Students considering a change in course level after the school year begins must 
complete a Program Change Request Form in consultation with their counselor.  
If a change in course level occurs after the first marking quarter grades are 
issued, grades from the former class will be transferred to the new class.   
At the end of the course, the receiving teacher may substitute a final grade (one 
grade higher or lower, e.g., B+ to an A or A to B+) that more accurately reflects the 
student’s level of achievement.  This procedure requires the approval of the 
department administrator and principal.  A Grade Correction form must be 
completed and filed. 
6. Prerequisites
Please check the course descriptions for prerequisites.
D.  PROGRAM PLANNING 
It is an important function of the High School to help each student individualize course selections 
in order to explore interests, develop skills and meet educational or career requirements.  
Curriculum presentations and orientation programs are designed to provide for a more informed 
selection of courses.  The process for planning will include the following:   
1. Program Planning Day
2. Teachers make recommendations for course selections
3. Scheduled Guidance Counselor meetings with individual students to review course
placements
4. Program verification forms will be made available to parents
5. Guidance Counselors will be available throughout the process to assist planning
E.  ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAM 
The Advanced Placement Program provides challenging, college-level experiences that better 
prepare students for the demands of college work.  This should be the primary reason for 
choosing this enriched experience.  Although many of the nation’s colleges and universities 
award credit, advanced placement, or both on the basis of exam grades, Syosset High School 
does not guarantee that this will occur.  Those decisions are determined by the policies of 
individual colleges and universities. 
Advanced Placement examinations, which are an integral part of the experience and a 
requirement for use of the A.P. trademark in the course title, are administered in May.  It is the 
expectation of Syosset High School that every A.P. student will sit for the exam in May.  If a 
student is unable to meet this expectation, he/she should discuss it with the guidance counselor. 
Student concerns regarding the cost of exams, college A.P. policies, and personal college 
admission decisions should be raised during the course selection process, not during the 
May examination period.  Any student who does not complete the A.P. exam for any reason will 
be required to complete a final exam of equal duration and difficulty. 
**Students should be mindful of the number of Advanced Placement courses they take during the 
school.  It is important to adhere to your teacher’s recommendation for placement of these 
courses**.   
[11] 
F.  COLLEGE COURSES 
Courses sponsored by colleges such as Syracuse University, LIU, SUNY Farmingdale, SUNY 
Stony Brook, and Five Towns College are available in English, Social Studies, Mathematics, 
World Languages, Business Education, Human Ecology, Technology, and Theatre Arts.  These 
courses provide an enriching college experience and college credit for many of our students.  
Although many other colleges will accept these credits, Syosset High School does not guarantee 
that this will occur.  Those decisions are determined by the policies of individual colleges and 
universities.  All students who choose to enroll in a college-sponsored course are required 
to pay the reduced tuition fees in the amount and by the deadline established by the 
colleges. 
G.   COLLEGE ADMISSIONS TESTS 
Preliminary SAT (PSAT)/National Merit Qualifying Test (NMSQT) 
The test measures Evidence Based Reading, math and writing skills that students develop over 
many years, both in and out of school.  The test is intended to let students practice for the SAT 
Reasoning Test and enter the National Merit Scholarship competition.  The PSAT is generally 
administered to students in October of junior year.  A sophomore who is considering this exam 
should discuss it with their guidance counselor to determine if he/she has the background that is 
covered on the test. 
https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/psat-nmsqt-psat-10/inside-the-test/key-features 
SAT Test  
This test measures Evidence Based Reading, writing, and mathematical skills.  Scores from this 
test provide colleges with a way to compare the academic preparation and ability of students who 
apply for admission.  In general, students will take the SAT Reasoning Test for Spring of their 
junior year. The link below provides a description of the exam: 
https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/inside-the-test/key-features  
American College Testing (ACT) Program 
This test measures skills in English, mathematics, reading, science reasoning, and writing.  We 
recommend that every student take this test with the writing section.  These areas are tested 
because they include the major areas of instruction in most high school and college programs.    
Scores from the test measure how well you can perform skills necessary for college coursework.  
Most colleges accept ACT scores for admission and placement as readily as they do SAT scores. 
In general, a student should register to take the ACT Spring of their junior year.  The link below 
provides a description of the exam: https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-
act.html 
SAT Subject Tests  
These tests measure knowledge or skills in a particular subject and your ability to apply that 
knowledge.  The tests are required for admissions and/or placement at some of the more 
competitive colleges (consult the college's catalogue or website for specific information).  The 
course descriptions that follow will include a reference to an SAT Subject Test if one is available. 
Consult the SAT Registration Bulletin or collegeboard.org for applicable test dates and 
registration procedures.  Also, speak with your counselor if you have questions about the 
appropriateness of the test(s) for you. 
[12] 
SAT Subject Tests are administered at Syosset High School in Literature, U.S. History, World 
History, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, French, German, Modern Hebrew, Italian, 
Latin, and Spanish.

H.  SUMMER SCHOOL ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS 
▪ A student must have been registered and in attendance for 75% of the course during
the school year in order to attend summer school.  Unusual cases, due to extenuating
circumstances, may be appealed to the high school principal.
▪ In order to receive credit for any summer school course, a student must obtain prior
written approval.
▪ For courses taught in the Syosset Central School District Program, the approval of the
guidance counselor or principal is required on the registration form.

I.  STUDENT EXPENSES 
In certain courses students are expected to incur some reasonable expenses.  They include 
materials used in the construction of projects which are kept by the students, articles of clothing 
appropriate to the activities in which they will participate, review books, field trips that are an 
integral part of the course, college tuition expenses, and Advanced Placement Exam fees.  If a 
student cannot afford to pay for a particular item, he/she should speak with the administrator of 
the respective department.  The expenses are listed with the course description 
[13] 
The Developmental School Counseling Program of Syosset secondary schools is a 
comprehensive plan of academic, career and personal development.  It is an integral part of the 
total school program and supports the goals established for all students. 
The Syosset School Counseling Program emphasizes the relationship between student and 
counselor.  It is the key to a successful program.  Through a series of sequential and 
developmental activities, the counselor ensures that he/she is meaningfully involved with each 
student during each year of the secondary school experience.  In this way the student is in the 
best position to learn, plan, and make positive decisions with the ongoing support and assistance 
of a counselor that knows him/her well. 
Integral to the success of a comprehensive, developmental program is a team approach that 
requires the cooperation and involvement of parents, staff members, and community 
organizations. 
Career Education is an important component in a developmental school counseling program.  It is 
important for all students, parents, staff and community members to know that Syosset High 
School offers a wide variety of vocational education programs without regard to sex, race, color, 
national origin or disability.  For more information, please contact your child’s counselor.

Naviance Student allows parents and students to research colleges by comparing GPA, 
standardized test scores, and other statistics to actual historical data from our high school for 
students who have applied and been admitted in the past.  In addition to general and 
admissions information, parents and students can access college information on academics, 
cost and financial aid, student body characteristics, extracurricular and athletic programs.  A 
link to each college’s website is provided. 
Students and parents may log onto their shared account where they will have access to the 
student’s personal academic information (GPA, SAT scores).  Students may begin compiling 
their list of prospective colleges and compare their own credentials with recent Syosset 
applicants to those schools.  With the ability to view the application outcomes (accepted, 
denied, waitlisted) for recent applications using GPA and SAT scores, students can gauge 
their chances of acceptance by comparing personal GPA/SAT statistics with those of 
successful applications. 
This program also offers an in-depth career and personality profiler.  Students will participate in 
small groups with their guidance counselor to complete these assessments to help them 
decide in which high school elective courses they may want to enroll.  These programs offer a 
series of career assessments which also helps students discover multiple career options and 
plan their career paths based on general areas of interest, level of education, and training 
required to achieve their individual goals and objectives.   
Naviance Programs offered through Guidance include: 
• 9th grade - Do What You Are Personality Profile Assessment in December

[17] 
Syosset High School's Independent Study Program offers students an opportunity to use their 
talents in an individualized pursuit of self-determined educational goals.  The program is divided 
into two parts--the academic and the professional internship.  Students can contract for no more 
than one independent study project in a single semester, fall or spring, and earn one-half credit 
for the successful completion of a semester's work. In certain cases a contract may be extended 
for an additional semester. 
To apply for either portion of the program, students must submit proposals for their projects. 
Application does not guarantee acceptance.  The appropriate advisor reviews each proposal.  
Students who are accepted may have their scholastic programs and class schedules adjusted to 
allow them appropriate time to pursue their studies during the school day.  However, all students 
will take no less than 5-1/2 credits. 
Parental permission is required for enrollment in independent study.  For questions regarding 
the academic research program, the student's guidance counselor should be contacted.  
For questions regarding the internship program, the Business Education Dept. should be 
contacted at 364-5718. 
ACADEMIC RESEARCH PROGRAM 
This aspect of independent study affords the participant an opportunity to explore in depth an 
area of his/her particular intellectual interest and talent.  It is, in effect, an opportunity for the 
student to write his/her own curriculum within guidelines. 
Interested students should see his/her guidance counselor who will direct the student to the 
appropriate department administrator.  The project must be discussed and approved by the 
department administrator.  Preceptors will be assigned with the help of the department 
administrator.

All major disciplines at Syosset High School expose the student body to the techniques required 
to conduct a research investigation.  The highly motivated research oriented student has the 
unique opportunity to participate in our Three Year Advanced Research Program which has 
interdisciplinary options.  These Advanced Research classes meet ninth period on alternate days 
throughout the school year.  Students are awarded a half-unit bonus credit for this honor’s class.  
A team comprised of business, mathematics, science, social studies, and technology teachers 
work with this select group of students.  All research students will be encouraged to participate in 
research during one summer.  The recommended summer research should be taken between 
their junior year and senior year.  It is hoped that the summer of research is coordinated with an 
established research program/facility or with a researcher from a university, hospital, laboratory, 
etc. 
All 9th grade honors science students take Research 1.  Students must apply to Advanced 
Research 10.  A completed application form and two teacher recommendations must be 
submitted in the spring prior to admission to the program.  One recommendation must be from a 
science teacher, and the other is from either an English, math or social studies teacher.  A 
maximum of 48 tenth grade students are selected each year to participate in the tenth grade 
Advanced Research Program.  Students will be taught the process of research and will be 
required to do research in one of the following disciplines: mathematics, science, or social 
science 
9624  ADVANCED RESEARCH 10 
(Science, Mathematics, or Social Science) 
Year, 1 Period, Ninth Period Alternate  
Day, ½ credit bonus point 
Prerequisite:  Completion of Research 1 (4614) with a B+ or better, completion of an advanced 
research application and teacher recommendations. 
Co-requisite:  Honors chemistry 
Recommended for:  Honor students, who in addition to being strong academically, are highly 
motivated to conduct research 
Description:  Advanced Research 10 students are given the opportunity to choose a research 
topic in mathematics, science, or social science.  Science students choose a research topic that 
will be the focus of their work during the entire school year.  The project may involve areas that 
focus on cause and effect relationships or practical applications of science in any of its branches.  
Background research is conducted, students plan a procedure and gather necessary materials, 
devices are built, data is collected and analyzed, and a paper is written.  Fifteen projects are 
selected to participate in the Long Island Science Congress.  Social Science students begin 
work on a topic that both suits their interest and is a manageable one to study after having visited 
libraries and read academic journals.  A research design is developed, the SHS Institutional 
Review Board reviews it, field studies are conducted, data is analyzed using a variety of statistical 
formulas, conclusions are reached, a determination for future studies are made, and a paper is 
written.  Mathematics students analyze problems and do mathematical research.  They are 
required to read articles; and after an area of interest is determined, article summaries are written 
that are relevant to the subject they have selected.  Open-ended questions are constructed, and 
ADVANCED RESEARCH PROGRAM 
[21] 
a paper is written which is submitted to the Long Island Math Fair.  A business education teacher 
will assist all Advanced Research 10 students in preparing presentation materials and skills to

by a closely knit team of teachers.  Students work on achieving success and instilling pride within 
themselves and throughout the school. 
Participation in the program is voluntary and requires an interview and agreement from the

The Communications Arts Program proposes both to build upon and to consolidate the media 
arts offerings which have a long tradition here at Syosset High School.  Many of our graduates 
move on to prestigious film schools and college communications programs.  Our various offerings 
have launched a number of careers in the media and entertainment industries.  To date, alumni of 
our program have won seven Emmy awards as well as ACE and Dore Schary awards, Streisand 
and Mobil grants.  Many others have gone on to careers as on-air personalities, sportscasters, 
producers, cinema/videographers, recording engineers, studio engineers, and performers as well 
as record company and media executives.  All of them cite their experiences here as critical to 
launching their careers. 
 
The courses in this program allow students to explore both the practical, hands-on aspects of 
communications as well as the more theoretical, aesthetic and cultural aspects.  The program will 
also encourage students to engage in projects that will cut across the curriculum and the school 
community so that they will experience first-hand the power of their work.  The Communication 
Arts Program is recommended for all students in grades 9 through 12 who are interested in 
careers in film, entertainment, broadcast journalism, broadcast and non-broadcast television, 
broadcast or communications management and broadcast engineering.

DRIVER EDUCATION 
 
 
 
 
 
Driver Education is given before and after school only and may require certain students to meet  
on Saturday mornings for driving practice in driver-training cars.  Enrollment in this course may  
curtail a student's participation in other after-school activities.  This should be considered carefully 
since attendance at all Driver Education classes is extremely important for compliance with the 
minimum requirements mandated by the State Education and Motor Vehicle Departments.  
 
Students are selected for the Driver Education course in the following way: 
 
1. The student must be a senior or a junior. 
 
2.  Before a student is scheduled for Driver Education, a parent/guardian must attend an 
informational meeting held in early January, June, or September before registration for  
 the course. 
 
3. If the demand for Driver Education is too great for the number of available places and the 
student meets the above prerequisites, the list of those selected for the course will be made  
 on the basis of age and grade--seniors are selected first, then oldest juniors.

ANIMAL DISSECTION POLICY 
 
The Board of Education of the Syosset CSD acknowledges the importance of the study of 
animals as part of the curriculum in certain life sciences courses.  Practical experience with 
structure and function in animals is an essential component of these studies.  The primary 
goals for the instructional process involving animals are to achieve an understanding of the 
life processes, to demonstrate biological principles, and to teach the proper care and 
handling of animals.  Instructional activities involving the investigation and/or dissection of 
animals will be adequately supervised and conducted with respect for life and a commitment 
to the safety of the students performing the investigations and dissections. 
 
The Board further recognizes that some students may have a moral or religious objection to 
the performance or witnessing of the dissection of an animal.  Students shall have the right to 
opt-out of performance or witnessing of dissection activities, provided that the student 
performs an alternative project that is approved by the student’s teacher.  The student’s 
moral or religious objection must be substantiated in writing by the student’s parent or 
guardian.  Students who perform alternative approved projects and do not perform or witness 
the dissection of animals shall not be penalized. 
 
At the commencement of the school year, parents and teachers will be advised of this policy 
through dissemination in the high school curriculum manual.  Teachers of courses that 
include animal dissection shall provide additional notice to the students in those classes of 
their opt-out rights and responsibilities under the law and this policy.  Such notice shall also 
be available upon request in the school office.

WORLD LANGUAGES 
 
 
  
 
In addition to developing communication skills in another language, Syosset’s World Language 
Department works to inspire joy, cultural literacy and global awareness in our students.  
Learners build proficiency in the target languages and become better communicators in 
English, as well.  Teachers create environments and experiences that engage students in the 
work of language learning.  We encourage the ongoing development of proficiency, from the 
novice through advanced levels.  We hope to inspire our students to be lifelong learners of the 
target languages.   
 
Syosset’s World Language Department creates opportunities for students to use their language 
skills in real-world contexts.  We offer a breadth of language choices, with pathways to success 
for all learners.  Teachers lead efforts to collaborate and grow our program, along with support 
from administrators, the community and parents.  Our instruction and assessments align with 
our vision.   
 
The World Languages program at Syosset follows the New York State syllabus for Languages 
Other Than English and the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) 
World Readiness Standards and Proficiency Guidelines.  The New York State curriculum 
includes three checkpoints along the proficiency continuum.  Checkpoints A (8th grade), B (10th 
grade), and C (12th grade).  Students’ skills build as they progress from one level to the next.    
 
Studying a World Language is a critical part of a student’s high school academic experience 
and an important part of being an educated global citizen.  It is also noted that studying a 
foreign language throughout high school is an essential part of a developing a favorable profile 
for college admissions.  Taking a language class during all four years of high school is as 
important as consistently studying any other core discipline.  Since language learning is 
cumulative in nature, it is best to study the same language throughout high school and beyond.  
Students choose among studying Chinese, French, Italian or Spanish beginning in 6th grade.   
In general, students continue in the same language at the high school.  Switching to a different 
language requires the approval of the World Language Coordinator. 
 
 New York State Regents Diploma Requirements 
One (1) high school credit is earned by passing the Checkpoint A Exam at the end of the 
eighth grade.  If a student does not take the Checkpoint A Exam, he/she must pass one year of 
a high school World Language in order to meet minimum graduation requirements. 
 
New York State Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation Requirements 
Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation candidates must successfully complete a 
sequence of 3 units of credit AND pass a Checkpoint B Exam in a World Language, which is 
given at the end of Level 3 of each language.   
 
STUDYING MULTIPLE LANGUAGES 
We also offer the following languages (in addition to French, Italian and Spanish): American 
Sign Language (ASL), Japanese, Latin, Mandarin Chinese (for seniors only), and Russian.   
Many students choose to study multiple languages at Syosset High School by adding one of 
the above languages to their program.   Studying multiple languages provides an even broader 
linguistic experience to students and is viewed favorably in the college admissions process.  
[151] 
 
NEW YORK STATE SEAL OF BILITERACY 
Students who attain an intermediate-high level of proficiency in a world language and English 
may be eligible for the New York State Seal of Biliteracy (NYSSOB), which is part of a national 
effort to recognize students who are literate in English plus another language.  The seal is 
placed on a student’s graduation diploma and it indicates their language skills to colleges and 
employers.  Students who are candidates for the NYSSOB demonstrate their skills in a number 
of ways, including a project which is completed during senior year.  This is a wonderful goal to 
work toward! 
 
FINAL EXAMINATIONS 
Course final examinations or alternative assessment evaluations are given in all courses other 
than Level 3 courses which culminate with a Checkpoint B Exam. 
 
HONORS LEVEL WORLD LANGUAGE COURSES 
Honors-level language courses are demanding and meant for students who are highly 
motivated language learners.  Honors coursework requires students to work well 
independently, be intrinsically motivated, and dedicate time and effort outside of class.  
Honors courses are accelerated and enriched, meaning students are expected to learn and 
use more language in a shorter amount of time.  The entire Level 2 curriculum is taught in 
9th grade, and the entire Level 3 curriculum is taught in 10th grade.  Students registering for 
French, Spanish or Italian 2 Honors in 9th grade, should have excellent grades, and their 
teacher’s recommendation.  Continuing in the program requires consistent effort, sustained 
motivation and ongoing interest in the target language and culture.  
 
ADVANCED PLACEMENT COURSES 
Advanced Placement courses in French, Spanish and Italian are taken in 12th grade by 
students enrolled in the Honors Program. Students are reminded that A.P. courses are very 
demanding.  All students enrolled in an A.P. course are required to pay for and take the 
corresponding A.P. examination in May.
